# Sorting-Searching-Algorithms
This is a scholar project about sorting and searching algorithms.

There are some bugs on some algorithms and searching algorithms are not implemented yet, currently you can find only 20 sorting algorithms.

Bugs:
- Comb sort switches some elements
- Heap sort does something weird
- Natural merge and Pancake sort are not implemented yet
- For some reason pigeonholesort changes all my numbers for twos
- Quick sort gives me an stack overflow
- Strand Sort is not implemented yet
